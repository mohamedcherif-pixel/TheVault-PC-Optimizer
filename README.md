# Ultimate PC Optimizer Pro

This is a Python-based GUI application that applies advanced PC tweaks and optimizations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pygame` (installed automatically by the script)

## Getting the Music File
The app expects a file named `Dark Fantasy - shahi77.mp3` in the same folder as `main.py`.

**Current Status:** The placeholder file is 114 bytes (not real audio). To use music:

### Option 1: Download from YouTube/Music Library
1. Search for "Dark Fantasy by shahi77" on YouTube or Spotify
2. Download as MP3 using a converter (yt5s.com, youtube-mp3.org, etc.)
3. Rename to `Dark Fantasy - shahi77.mp3`
4. Place in the same folder as `main.py`

### Option 2: Use Any Other MP3
Just rename any MP3 to `Dark Fantasy - shahi77.mp3` and place it in the folder.

### Option 3: Skip Music for Now
The app works without music. The music button shows ⚠️ if the file is invalid; click it for details.

## How to Run
1. Ensure pygame is installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```
2. **(Optional)** Place your MP3 file as described above
3. Run with admin privileges:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   The script will request Administrator privileges automatically.

## Debug Output
Run from a terminal to see music loading details:
```bash
python main.py
```
Console will show `✓ Music loaded and playing` or error messages.

## How to Create a Standalone `.exe`
To convert this Python script into a standalone Windows executable (so you don't need Python installed to run it):

1. Install PyInstaller:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```
2. Build the executable:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile main.py
   ```
3. Your `.exe` will be located in the `dist` folder.
4. Make sure to place `Dark Fantasy - shahi77.mp3` in the same folder as the generated `.exe` for the music to play.

## How to Create a `setup.exe` Installer
To create a professional installer for your program:
1. Download and install **Inno Setup** (https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).
2. Open Inno Setup and use the Script Wizard.
3. Point the main executable to the `main.exe` generated by PyInstaller in the `dist` folder.
4. Add `Dark Fantasy - shahi77.mp3` as an additional file to be installed in the same destination folder.
5. Compile the script in Inno Setup, and it will generate a `setup.exe` for you!
